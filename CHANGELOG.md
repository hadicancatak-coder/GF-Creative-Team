## [1.0.0] — 2026-09-07

First public release.

### Added
- Seven role agents: creative-director, art-director, designer, design-analyst, quality-officer,
  content-creator, financial-controller.
- `creative-gate` skill and `/creative-gate` command — the mandatory review gate.
- `/new-client` command — scaffolds a client profile and seeds its evals.
- Two deterministic workflows: `creative-gate.js` (plan → parallel gates → consolidated verdict) and
  `build-verify-loop.js` (select → build → verify → one fix round → PASS/ESCALATE).
- Enforcement hooks: build logging on design-tool writes, and a Stop hook that blocks ending a session
  with ungated builds (with a human waiver hatch).
- 23 domain-agnostic eval cases in `evals/universal-cases.md`, each naming the responsible agent.
- Client layer: `clients/TEMPLATE/` plus a fictional worked example, `clients/example-northwind-cycles/`.
- `docs/METHOD.md`, `docs/QUICKSTART.md`, and `examples/worked-gate-run.md`.

### Notes
This release is a clean extraction of a private, single-client tool. The role briefs, laws and eval
cases are unchanged in substance — every client-specific fact was moved into the client layer, and the
originating client's profile is not part of this repository.
